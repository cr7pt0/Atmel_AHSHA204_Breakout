# ATSHA204 Breakout Repository for Spark Core
Refer to [SparkFun ATSHA204 Breakout](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11551) for complete set of Arduino files.

## What's here?
A single set of library files and sample code for compiling in web IDE, Spark CLI or via local toolchain.


## What is the Atmel ATSHA204?
The Atmel ATSHA204 is an optimized authentication chip that includes a 4.5Kb EEPROM. This array can be used for storage of keys, miscellaneous read/write, read-only, password or secret data, and consumption tracking. Access to the various sections of memory can be restricted in a variety of ways and then the configuration locked to prevent changes.

Each ATSHA204 ships with a guaranteed unique 72-bit serial number. Using the cryptographic protocols supported by the chip, a host system or remote server can prove that the serial number is both authentic and not a copy. The ATSHA204 can generate high-quality random numbers and employ them for any purpose, including usage as part of the crypto protocols of this chip.
